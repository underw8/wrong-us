### üîç **Ongoing Monitoring:**

After publication:

- **Monitor user feedback** for issues AI generation might have missed
- **Regular security reviews** of AI-generated code
- **Community contributions** to improve code quality
- **Version updates** to address any discovered issues

### üìû **Support Strategy:**

For user issues:

1. **Check known AI limitations** in our issue tracker
2. **Review AI-generated code** for potential improvements
3. **Engage community** for human expertise on complex issues
4. **Document patterns** for future AI generation projects
