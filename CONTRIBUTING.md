- Human oversight ensures functionality and testing
- AI-generated code may have patterns humans wouldn't use
- Some approaches might benefit from human expertise

### 🔍 **How You Can Help:**

#### **Code Review & Improvement**

- **Review AI-generated patterns** - Suggest more idiomatic approaches
- **Performance optimization** - Identify inefficient AI-generated code
- **Security review** - Audit for potential security issues
- **Best practices** - Improve code structure and maintainability

#### **Feature Development**

- **Human-authored features** - Add new functionality with human insight
- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues that AI generation might have missed
- **Testing improvements** - Enhance test coverage and quality

#### **Documentation**

- **Code comments** - Explain complex AI-generated logic
- **User guides** - Improve documentation with human empathy
- **Examples** - Add real-world usage examples
